# # we use double quote with strings for example our name
# print("umer rukhsar")
# # we do not use double / single quote with numbers or variables
# print(4)

# # we can also perform basic arithematic operations
# print(2 + 2)

# num = 10
# print(num)
# # variable value can be changed
# num = 1.1
# print(num)

# # to check a type of variable, we use built-in type function
# age = 23
# print(  type(age)  )

# # constant can not be changed, they are written in bold letters
# PI = 3.142
# print(2 * PI * 3)
